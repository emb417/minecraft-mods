# Minecraft Mods

Created simple minecraft mods by following [Minecraft Modding with Forge: A Family-Friendly Guide to Building Fun Mods in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-Modding-Forge-Family-Friendly-Building/dp/1491918896) with my 8 year old son.  The official github repo is [https://github.com/devoxx4kids/materials/tree/master/workshops/minecraft](https://github.com/devoxx4kids/materials/tree/master/workshops/minecraft).

The mods are all Java based, using the Eclipse IDE for development and Forge for testing the client-side mods.
